# The association of Mage-OS Nederland

**Since the beginning of 2023, Mage-OS Netherlands has been registered as an association and we are working on a new future of Magento in the Netherlands. By becoming a member you help us organize events, improve communication between merchants and agencies and much more.**

### Register as a new member {#lidworden}
Do you also want to be part of this new Magento community? [Register as a member](/en/lid-worden). Membership costs 10 Euro per year. Once this contribution has been paid, you will become a permanent member.

### Committees / working groups
While the board monitors processes, encourages and facilitates people, further work is delegated to working groups led by committees. Below is a list of the current committees/working groups:

- **Meet Magento NL commissie**: Meet Magento Netherlands is organized every year and since the founding of Mage-OS Netherlands, this has been done through a committee of volunteers.
 
- **Legal Committee**: The articles of association were approved at the time of incorporation on Wednesday, January 18, 2023, but some further refinements may be required. A committee led by Jisse Reitsma, Roland Haselager and Sander de Graaf would like to ask the community to help draw up pieces correctly, so that the basis is good.

- **Event Committee**: Will there be another MeetMagento Netherlands? That is the question that concerns many people. And with Mage-OS Nederland we hope to breathe new life into it. Led by Sanne Bolkenstein, Michiel Gerritsen and Core de Reeper, a group is looking at the possibilities.

- **Content committee**: The website should be adjusted, social media should be streamlined, newsletters should be in order. Jeroen Boersma, Roland Haselager and Jisse Reitsma are working on better content. And input from others is a must.

- **Sponsor committee**: Under the leadership of Sanne Bolkenstein and Sander de Graaf, sponsorship options are examined, such as event-specific sponsors or, for example, a general sponsor on the website.

### Articles of association and internal regulations
The articles of association can be found on the page [Articles of association Mage-OS Netherlands](/Articles of association).
